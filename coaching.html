    <h2>Coaching</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <p>I serve clients as a transformational coach. What is coaching, exactly? I appreciate the definition that's given by the <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/about#:~:text=ICF%20defines%20coaching%20as%20partnering%20with%20clients%20in%20a%20thought%2Dprovoking%20and%20creative%20process%20that%20inspires%20them%20to%20maximize%20their%20personal%20and%20professional%20potential.%20The%20process%20of%20coaching%20often%20unlocks%20previously%20untapped%20sources%20of%20imagination%2C%20productivity%20and%20leadership.">International Coaching Federation</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>"Partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. The process of coaching often unlocks previously untapped sources of imagination, productivity and leadership."</blockquote>
    <p>Do you feel unfulfilled in your friendly, familial, professional, or romantic relationships? Do you feel bogged down by thoughts or emotions that don't serve you but which you're not sure how to process? Are you seeking clarity on what professional trajectory, personal project, or side hobby you want to invest your time and energy, and how you want to do that? Do you feel stuck in your finances? Home life? Spiritual life? It would be my honor and pleasure to serve you as your coach, by being the person that will listen to you in a way that no one else will listen, asking you questions that no one else will ask you, and challenging you in ways that no one else will challenge you.</p>

    <p>I am certified as an Associate Transformational Coach through the <a href="https://satvatove.com/">Satvatove Institute</a>, and I am currently working towards certification as an Associate Certified Coach through the <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/">International Coaching Federation</a>.

    <p>I conduct my coaching on a sliding scale. In other words, while I do have established prices for my coaching packages, I am ready to work with you to fix a price for my services that meets your financial needs. Additionally, because I believe that the best way for you to reach a decision on whether you would like to coach with me is by experiencing my coaching first-hand.</p>
    <p>Here are the standard prices for my coaching services:</p>
    <div id="coaching-packages">
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>

    <p>Do you have further questions, or would you like to share your thoughts? I invite you to get in touch and I'll be happy to communicate further. You can reach me at hugo.jakub.stetz@gmail.com.</p>
