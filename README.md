# Hugo Jakub Stetz - Personal Website

This project constitutes my personal website. It is where I get to build my personal website and thus simultaneously create my own promotional/informational material and also practice coding.

Purposes of the website:
- Serve as my first impression to someone connecting with me.
- Introduce me.
- Explain my coaching services.
- Articulate pricing for my coaching services.
- Serve as a portfolio for my various software projects.

This website is built using the standard triad of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
